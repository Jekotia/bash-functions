WARNING

This repo should presently be considered unstable. The only reason it's on GitHub in this state is because one of my personal use-cases is automated server deployment & configuration. As such, it needs to be available via Git during testing.

If you wish to use this, you must source the file `init`. This will manually load in the core functions not ending with .sh, and trigger the loader for the remaining *.sh files under this tree. To use the functions, call them like you usually would any other bash function.
