# As of writing, there are no single-character TLD's. However, they would be
# technically valid. So as to avoid the effectiveness of this script relying on
# being updated as new TLD's are approved, no steps are taken to verify that a
# TLD exists; only that the one supplied is valid in regards to the RFC5322
# specification.

# For testing consistency, the base email address that is then modified must be
# 'user@domain.tld'. For a subdomain, it should be 'user@sub.domain.tld'.
# Service-specific tests are to be added to the 'Email Service Tests' section
# at the bottom.
